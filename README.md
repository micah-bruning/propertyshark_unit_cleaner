# Property Shark Unit Data Cleaner
Property shark's unit data is very messy. The mail cleaner class does all of the data cleaning from the units. The data is exported as a csv and is ready to upload to a major mail marketing
platform such as Poplar. 

The download addresses file is the driver code which downloads all of the cleaned data into corresponding CSVs. The mailcleaner class contains all of the methods for actually
cleaning the data.
